             <p> This page should focus on your brand's background. What's your unique story? Why
                should prospective clients choose to sign up with you? This is your chance to build a
                relationship with them, starting with your backstory, vision, or philosophy. You can even
                share your brand's beginnings if you feel that it's relatable to your clients. Just remember to
                be friendly, and welcoming.</p>
               <p> Once you're done, seal the deal with a compelling closing line that gets them to take action</p>
